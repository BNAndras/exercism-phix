# Tests

## From the command line
 
Simply type `p test`. It is assumed that the path to the phix binaries has been declared in the PATH environment variable.

See [Unit Testing][unit-testing] for details of the testing framework normally used.
  
## Editing the test.exw file(s)
 
This is encouraged at the beginning of your journey. Insert a `--` before all but the first one or two tests. Save the test file. 
Write your code to solve the first test or two. Then progressively enable more tests until you can pass all of them.
